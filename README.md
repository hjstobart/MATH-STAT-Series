## Mathematics & Statistics Series

Want to learn more about mathematics and statistics topics? Already studied them in the past but simply forgotten? Well this series is here to help!

`** The May-22 issue is now live, check it out. **`

## Overview

This series contains reviews, guides, and examples of variety of different mathematics and statistics topics. My aim is to publish one per month. As with the majority of my repositories, there are two reasons for its creation.

The first is to serve as a reminder for myself. I continuously fall into the second category outlined above, that is, I have studied these things in the past but have forgetten them over time. As one of my lecturers said, _"Mathematics is not a spectator sport!"_ 

The second reason is that in reminding myself I hope this series will also help others in their journey. To those that do happen to stumble across these guides, please note I am not infallible. There may indeed be mistakes or typos, and I would very much appreciate anyone who spots something as such, so I may correct it for the future.
